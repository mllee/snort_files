Networks Final Project:
Snort Server Protection

This project is a venture into learning how Snort works in detecting malicious
traffic against a server, and what rules/systems can be put in place 
using Snort to help flag potentially dangerous traffic (like a DDOS)

Because the code is all over the place (all different parts of the server's
filesystem as well as some client-side code), this git repo is a bit messy
in serving as a versioning system. However, I'll have all the relevant code accessible
here.

Most of the relevant work is in rules/rules.local, and much of the demo
is from running rules in that file.
